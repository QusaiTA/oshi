     * The sysctl() function retrieves system information and allows processes with
     * appropriate privileges to set system information. The information available
     * from sysctl() consists of integers, strings, and tables.

     * The state is described using a &quot;Management Information Base&quot; (MIB) style
     * name, listed in name, which is a namelen length array of integers.
     *
     * The information is copied into the buffer specified by oldp. The size of the
     * buffer is given by the location specified by oldlenp before the call, and
     * that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful call and
     * after a call that returns with the error code ENOMEM. If the amount of data
     * available is greater than the size of the buffer supplied, the call supplies
     * as much data as fits in the buffer provided and returns with the error code
     * ENOMEM. If the old value is not desired, oldp and oldlenp should be set to
     * NULL.
     *
     * The size of the available data can be determined by calling sysctl() with the
     * NULL argument for oldp. The size of the available data will be returned in
     * the location pointed to by oldlenp. For some operations, the amount of space
     * may change often. For these operations, the system attempts to round up so
     * that the returned size is large enough for a call to return the data shortly
     * thereafter.
     *
     * To set a new value, newp is set to point to a buffer of length newlen from
     * which the requested value is to be taken. If a new value is not to be set,
